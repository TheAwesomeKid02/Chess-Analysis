<h1>Chess Analysis</h1>
This program is a project created by two students (including me). Here are the steps to use this repository.<br/><br/>

<ol>
  <li>Download this repository. Make sure to take note of the path.</li>
  <li>There is a secret (ENV) parameter of the port. Change this to whatever port you like.</li>
  <li>Run <code>main.py</code></li>
  <li>Observe the console. It will tell you the IP of the URL. Enter this in a web browser.</li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
You are all set! If you have any questions or there are issues in the program, make sure to put it in the "Issues" section of this repository

<h3>NOTE: The available moves feature is temporarily not working. We are trying to fix this issue as soon as possible.</h3>
